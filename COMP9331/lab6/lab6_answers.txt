Exercise 1:
Q3: If he wants to be contactable on just 1 IP address
    If he wants to change local IPs without notifying the outside world
    If he wants to change ISP without changing IPs on local devices

Exercise 2:
Q4: SYN 4164040420
7.075657000
source: 192.168.1.100: 4335
destination: 64.233.169.104: 80

Q5: ACK 3914283156
source: 64.233.169.104: 80
destination: 192.168.1.100: 4335
received: 7.108986000

Q9: Only checksum was changed - why? Because the NAT modifies the port number and IP address which requires a recalculation of the TCP and IP checksum.

Q13:
SYN:
Source: 71.192.34.104
Destination: 64.233.169.104
ACK:
Source: 64.233.169.104
Destination: 71.192.32.104

Different: Source for SYN and destination for ACK. So the client IP is different. Server IPs are the same.
