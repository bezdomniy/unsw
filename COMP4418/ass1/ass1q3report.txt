Assignment 1:
Question 3 report:

The solution is implemented in C++17. To build the executable, run make. To execute, type ./assnq1 'your query'

The solution contains 2 classes, and 2 namespaces (for static functions) in separate files (each with .cpp and .h). 

The Sequent class is used to parse, store, and represent (print) a sequenet in the form eg. '[x, y] seq [y, x neg z]'. 

The SearchTree files contain a struct for a Node, with a possible pair of sequent values (to represent backward split into 2 sequents), a list of pointers to children nodes, and a pointer to it's parent node. The SearchTree class initialises from and stores a root node, and contains functions to build the search tree from an input sequent.

The Rule namespace contains functions to check whether a formula can be tranformed according to a rule, and to perform this transformation.

The Utils namespaces contains functions for string processing using regex functions. Some examples are finding the outermost rule keyword (outside all brackets), stripping brackets, and splitting a string into a list.
